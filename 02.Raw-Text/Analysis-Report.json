How does stock option level influence employee retention\nand satisfaction?\n\n\n\n3) Compensation Analysis:\nAge Impact on Job Satisfaction and Attrition:\nHow does job satisfaction vary across different age groups?\nWhat is the attrition rate for different age groups?\n\n3) Compensation Analysis:\nGender Differences in Job Satisfaction and Performance:\n How does job satisfaction vary between male and female\nemployees?\n Is there a difference in performance ratings between male\nand female employees?\n\n3) Compensation Analysis:\nEducation Level and its Impact on Performance and Salary:\n How does education level influence employee performance\nand salary variation?\n How does education level impact employee performance?\n How does salary vary by education level?\n How does education level impact employee performance by\nmanager rating?\nMarital Status and Attrition:\nHow does marital status influence attrition rates and job\nsatisfaction?\n Does marital status affect attrition rates?\n Is there a relationship between marital status and job\nsatisfaction?\n\n\n\n\n2. Geographic Insights:\n4) Work Environment:\n 8.Is there a correlation between overtime work and\nperformance or attrition?\n 9.How does business travel affect employee satisfaction and\nretention?\n\n\n2.Geographic Insights:\n18.Is there a correlation between overtime work and performance\nor attrition?\nApproach: We'll analyze the relationship between `OverTime`\nand `Attrition`\n19.How does business travel affect employee satisfaction\nand retention?\nWe analyzed how `BusinessTravel` impacts `JobSatisfaction`\nand `Attrition` by computing their averages for each category\nand visualizing the trends using bar plots.\n\n20.How does the distance from home affect job satisfaction?\nWe analyze the relationship between `DistanceFromHome`\nand `JobSatisfaction` by computing their correlation and\nvisualizing the distribution using a box plot.\n21.Which states have the highest and lowest attrition rates?\nWe’ll group by the `State` column and calculate the `attrition`\nrate for each state.\n22.Which states have the highest percentage of employees\nleaving due to excessive overtime?\nWe can compute the `Attrition` rate among `OverTime`\nworkers by filtering employees where `Attrition = 1` and\n`OverTime = 1`, then calculating the percentage per `State`.\n\n23.How does work-life balance affect overall job satisfaction?\nWe can use BusinessTravel to analyze its impact on\n`WorkLifeBalance` ratings and visualize the distribution of\nwork-life balance across different business travel\nfrequencies, while highlighting how `DistanceFromHome`\nrelates to `ManagerRating` and how `WorkLifeBalance`\ninfluences JobSatisfaction.\n24.Is there a relationship between work-life balance and\nbusiness travel frequency?\nWe can use `BusinessTravel` to analyze its impact on\n`WorkLifeBalance` ratings and visualize the distribution of\nwork-life balance across different business travel\nfrequencies.\n25.How does participation in training programs impact\nemployee performance?\nWe can use `Education` as a proxy for training and skill level\nto analyze its impact on `Salary`.\n______________________________________________\n26.Is there a connection between training and job\nsatisfaction or promotion rates?\nWe can use `TrainingOpportunitiesTaken` to evaluate how\ntraining affects `JobSatisfaction` and\n`YearsSinceLastPromotion`.\n\n4. Behavioral Insights:\n27.What are the trends in performance ratings across\ndepartments and demographics?\nWe will analyze how `PerformanceRating` varies across\n`Department` and `Gender`.\n\n28.How does tenure (YearsAtCompany) impact performance\nand promotion rates?\nTo examine this, we can analyze how `YearsAtCompany`\naffects both `PerformanceRating` and\n`YearsSinceLastPromotion`.\n\n\n29.What is the average time to promotion for employees, and\ndoes it vary by department or gender?\nWe'll calculate the average `YearsSinceLastPromotion` and\ngroup the data by `Department` and `Gender`.\n\n____________________________________________________\n30.Are employees with longer tenure more likely to have\nhigher performance ratings?\nWe analyze the correlation between `YearsAtCompany` and\n`ManagerRating` using regression and quartile-based\ngrouping. Columns used: `YearsAtCompany`,\n`ManagerRating`, `TenureGroup`.\n\n____________________________________________________\n31.How does performance rating correlate with job\nsatisfaction?\nWe can calculate the average `jobSatisfaction` for each\n`SelfRating` and create a boxplot to visualize the distribution\nof job satisfaction based on self-rating, highlighting\ndifferences based on attrition status.\n\n____________________________________________________\n32.What is the attrition rate for employees with different\nperformance ratings?\nWe can group the data by `PerformanceRating` and calculate\nthe attrition rate for each rating level.\n\n____________________________________________________\n33.What is the impact of overtime on job satisfaction?\nSince we do not have a direct measure of job satisfaction, we\ncan analyze the impact of `OverTime` on\n`PerformanceRating` and use that as a proxy for satisfaction.\n\n\n34.Is there a relationship between overtime and\nperformance?\nWe analyze whether working `overtime` impacts `SelfRating`\nby comparing average ratings and conducting a statistical\ntest.\n\n35.Can we predict the likelihood of attrition based on\nemployee attributes?\nWe can create a predictive model to determine the likelihood\nof attrition (`Attrition`) using attributes like\n`YearsAtCompany`, `OverTime`, `PerformanceRating`, etc.\nWe'll use Logistic Regression for this predictive task.\n____________________________________________________\n36.Are there any leading indicators of high-performing\nemployees?\nWe can try to identify features that predict high performance\n(`PerformanceRating`).\n\nData Dynamos"
