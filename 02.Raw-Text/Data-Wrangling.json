Key fields\ninclude:\n• Demographics: Gender, Age, Ethnicity, MaritalStatus\n• Job Details: Department, DistanceFromHome, BusinessTravel, HireDate\n• Performance and Tenure: PerformanceRating, YearsAtCompany,\nYearsInMostRecentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager\n• Compensation: Salary, StockOptionLevel\n• Other: OverTime, Attrition\n❖ Merging Data for Better Insights:\n• We used merge operations to integrate datasets.\n• This process made it easier to analyze key factors affecting each element.\n❖ Working with Nested Data:\n• In case of nested data, we will use data explosion techniques to convert these\nlists into rows, making each element analyzable individually.\n• This allowed us to compute metrics.\n❖ Summary of Our Discussion & Contributions:\n Key Contributions:\n• Cleaned and organized data from multiple HR datasets.\n• Merged essential data points.\n• Handled complex data structures to make the data ready for analysis.\nData Dynamos"
