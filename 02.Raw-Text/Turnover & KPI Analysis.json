The code is organized into\nsections with clear objectives, supporting visualizations, and key insights.\nStage 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\nObjective\nLoad and prepare HR data from an Excel file, converting date columns appropriately and\nverifying the initial data samples.\nMethodology:\n• The Excel file HrData.xlsx is loaded using pandas and all necessary sheets\n(Employee, PerformanceRating, SatisfiedLevel) are read into separate DataFrames.\n• Date columns such as HireDate and ReviewDate are converted to datetime format\nto facilitate time based analysis.\n• The first few rows of the Employee and Performance Rating data are printed to verify\nthat the data has been loaded correctly.\nResults\nA preview of the first few rows of both the Employee and Performance Rating data.\nConfirmation that date columns are in datetime format.\n\nAnalysis 1: KPI Analysis\nObjective\nMeasure HR performance using key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:\nEmployee Turnover Rate: The percentage of employees who have left the company.\nEmployee Satisfaction: The average satisfaction score calculated from various satisfaction metrics.\n(Additional KPIs like Absenteeism Rate and Hiring Efficiency are mentioned as placeholders for future\nexpansion.)\nMethodology\nTurnover Rate Calculation:\n• Calculate the percentage of employees who have left (i.e., those with Attrition ==\n'Yes').\nEmployee Satisfaction Calculation:\n• Identify the latest performance review for each employee based on the most recent\nReviewDate.\n• Compute an overall satisfaction score by averaging selected satisfaction columns\n(e.g., EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction, and\nWorkLifeBalance).\nVisualization:\n• Create a bar chart that summarizes the calculated KPIs.\nInsight:\n• The printed turnover rate and average employee satisfaction score.\n• A bar chart labeled \"HR KPI Dashboard\" that visualizes these KPIs.\n\n\nAnalysis 2: Turnover Analysis\nObjective\nAnalyze employee turnover to understand attrition patterns, focusing on:\n• Identifying why employees leave.\n• Determining whether a significant percentage of employees leave within their first\nyear, which could indicate issues with onboarding or training.\nMethodology:\n1. Filter Attrited Employees: Create a subset of employees who have left (i.e., where Attrition == 'Yes').\nCalculate their tenure using the YearsAtCompany column.\n2. Tenure Distribution Visualization: Plot a histogram showing the distribution of tenure among attrited\nemployees.\n3. First-Year Attrition Calculation: Calculate the percentage of attrited employees with a tenure of one\nyear or less.\n4. Comparison with Current Employees: Similarly, analyze the tenure distribution for current\nemployees. Compare the average tenure between attrited and current employees.\nInsight:\n.\nA histogram showing the distribution of tenure among attrited employees.\n.\nThe calculated percentage of employees leaving within their first year.\n.\nA histogram showing the tenure distribution for current employees.\n.\nPrinted average tenure for both attrited and current employee groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nKPI Analysis:\n• The turnover rate and average employee satisfaction are key metrics that help assess HR\nperformance.\n• The KPI dashboard visualization provides a quick, digestible view of these metrics.\nTurnover Analysis:\n• The tenure distribution of attrited employees indicates the time at which most employees leave\nthe organization.\n• A notable percentage of first-year attrition may signal issues in onboarding, training, or early\nemployee engagement.\n• Comparing the tenure of attrited versus current employees can guide HR in understanding\nretention challenges.\n___________________________________________\nDataDynamos"
