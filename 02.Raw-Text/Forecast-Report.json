The code processes employee and\nperformance data from an Excel file, trains machine learning models, and\nmakes predictions for new employees.\nOverview of the Code Structure\nThe code is structured into five main stages:\n1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads and prepares the data for analysis.\n2. Model Training Functions: Defines reusable functions for training classification and\nregression models.\n3. Input Validation and Preprocessing: Collects and validates input data for new\nemployees.\n4. Question-Specific Code: Addresses specific HR questions using trained models.\n5. Predictions for New Employees: Uses trained models to predict HR-related\noutcomes.\nStage 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\nPurpose\nThis stage loads employee data from an Excel file and prepares it for analysis by merging\ndatasets and encoding categorical variables.\nMethods and Rationale\n• Loading Data: Reads \"Employee\" and \"PerformanceRating\" sheets from an Excel\nfile.\n• Merging Datasets: Uses a left join on \"EmployeeID\" to retain all employee records.\n• Handling Missing Values: The dropna() function ensures data completeness.\n• One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical variables into binary columns using\npd.get_dummies() to make data suitable for machine learning models.\nResults\n• A clean, merged dataset with numerical features ready for analysis.\n• Available columns are printed to help users understand the data structure.\nStage 2: Model Training Functions\nPurpose\nDefines functions for training classification and regression models, reducing redundancy\nand ensuring consistency.\nMethods and Rationale\n• Classification Model: Uses RandomForestClassifier, which is robust and handles\nnon-linear relationships well.\n• Regression Model: Uses LinearRegression for predicting continuous values.\n• Evaluation Metrics:\no Classification: Accuracy and classification report (precision, recall, F1-\nscore).\no Regression: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.\nResults\n• Trained models are stored for later use.\n• Model performance metrics are printed.\nStage 3: Input Validation and Preprocessing\nPurpose\nEnsures input data matches the training format for accurate predictions.\nMethods and Rationale\n• Numerical Inputs: Validated against predefined ranges (e.g., Age: 18–65).\n• Categorical Inputs: One-hot encoded to match training data.\n• DataFrame Alignment: Uses reindex() to match input data with trained model\nfeatures.\nResults\n• A properly formatted DataFrame for making predictions.\nStage 4: Question-Specific Code\nPredictive Analysis Questions\n1. Attrition Likelihood: Uses a classification model to predict employee turnover.\n2. Expected Tenure: A regression model estimates how long an employee might stay.\n3. Performance Rating Prediction: Identifies key factors affecting performance\nratings.\n4. Job Satisfaction Level: Uses classification to predict satisfaction levels.\n5. Promotion Likelihood: Predicts which employees are likely to be promoted.\n6. Retention Strategies: Identifies high-risk groups and suggests interventions.\n7. Impact of Overtime on Attrition: Uses data visualization to analyze trends.\n8. Salary Prediction: A regression model estimates expected salary based on job role\nand experience.\nResults\n• Models provide data-driven insights for HR decision-making.\nStage 5: Predictions for New Employees\nPurpose\nApplies trained models to predict HR outcomes based on new employee data.\nMethods and Rationale\n• Predictions are generated for:\no Attrition Likelihood\no Expected Tenure\no Job Satisfaction\no Promotion Readiness\no Expected Salary\nResults\n• Provides actionable predictions to support HR strategy.\nExample:\nEnter new employee details:\nAge: 28\nEducation: 2\nYearsAtCompany: 10\nYearsInMostRecentRole: 10\nYearsWithCurrManager: 10\nEnvironmentSatisfaction: 4\nJobSatisfaction: 3\nRelationshipSatisfaction: 5\nWorkLifeBalance: 4\nSelfRating: 5\nManagerRating: 4\nSalary: 218406\n___________________________________________\nOverTime options:\n1. refers to 'Yes'\n2. refers to 'No'\nOverTime (enter 1 or 2): 2\n___________________________________________\nDepartment options:\n1. refers to 'Human Resources'\n2. refers to 'Sales'\n3. refers to 'Technology'\nDepartment (enter 1, 2, or 3): 3\nJobRole options:\n1. refers to 'Analytics Manager'\n2. refers to 'Data Scientist'\n3. refers to 'Engineering Manager'\n4. refers to 'HR Business Partner'\n5. refers to 'HR Executive'\n6. refers to 'HR Manager'\n7. refers to 'Machine Learning Engineer'\n8. refers to 'Manager'\n9. refers to 'Recruiter'\n10. refers to 'Sales Executive'\n11. refers to 'Sales Representative'\n12. refers to 'Senior Software Engineer'\n13. refers to 'Software Engineer'\nJobRole (enter 1-13): 12\n___________________________________________\nOverall Interpretation\n• Data Preparation: Ensures high-quality input for accurate predictions.\n• Model Performance: Provides reliable HR insights.\n• Actionable Insights: Helps HR teams make data-driven decisions.\n• User Interaction: Guides users through input collection and delivers clear\npredictions.\nThis structured approach enhances HR analytics, enabling organizations to manage\nworkforce challenges and improve employee retention proactively.\n___________________________________________\nPredictive Questions\n1) Employee Turnover\nWhich employees are likely to leave the organization based on factors\nlike job satisfaction, education level, or performance rating?\nAnalysis: Using the Random Forest Classifier, the model achieved an accuracy of\n96.82%. The key features influencing promotion predictions include:\n• Years Since Last Promotion: Employees who had a recent promotion were less\nlikely to be promoted again.\n• Job Satisfaction & Manager Rating: Employees with higher ratings had a better\nchance of promotion.\n• Years at Company: Employees with longer tenures had slightly higher chances of\npromotion.\n2) Tenure Prediction\nHow long is an employee expected to stay at the company?\nAnalysis: Using the Random Forest Classifier, the attrition model achieved an\naccuracy of 95.74%. Findings include:\n• Overtime: Employees working overtime had a significantly higher attrition rate.\n• Salary: Lower salaries were associated with a greater likelihood of leaving.\n• Job Satisfaction: Had minimal impact on predicting attrition.\nEmployee Tenure Insights:\nAverage tenure: 4.62 years\n•\nMedian tenure: 4.0 years\n•\nPredicted expected tenure : 5.18 years\n•\n3) Attrition Prediction\nWhat is the likelihood that an employee will leave the company based on\ntheir data (e.g., age, job role, years of service, salary, etc.)?\nTo predict the likelihood of an employee leaving based on various factors (e.g., age, job\nrole, years of service, salary, etc.), I'll:\n1. Expand the dataset to include more relevant features (age, job role, salary, years at\ncompany, etc.).\n2. Train a predictive model (Random Forest or Logistic Regression) to estimate attrition\nprobability.\n3. Allow you to input an employee's details to predict their likelihood of leaving.\nAttrition Prediction Model Performance:\nAccuracy: 85.27%\n•\nPrecision (No Attrition): 87.14%\n•\nPrecision (Attrition): 69.23%\n•\nRecall (No Attrition): 97.12%\n•\nRecall (Attrition): 34.67%\n•\n4) Performance Prediction\nWhat are the key factors that predict high or low employee performance\nratings?\nAnalysis: Using the Random Forest Model, key factors impacting job satisfaction are:\n• Salary (31.2%): Higher salaries strongly correlate with job satisfaction.\n• Age (19.4%): Older employees report higher satisfaction levels.\n• Years at Company (13.1%): Longer tenure contributes to higher satisfaction.\n5) Job Satisfaction Prediction\nWhat is the level of job satisfaction of an employee based on factors\nlike travel, salary, management, etc.?\nAnalysis: Using the Random Forest Model, key factors impacting job satisfaction are:\n• Salary (30.5%): Higher salaries strongly correlate with job satisfaction.\n• Age (18.9%): Older employees report higher satisfaction levels.\n• Years at Company (12.3%): Longer tenure contributes to higher satisfaction.\n6) Promotion Readiness\nWhich employees are most likely to be promoted based on their\nperformance and tenure?\nAnalysis: Using the Random Forest Classifier, the strongest indicators of\npromotion likelihood include:\n• Years at Company (0.86 correlation).\n• Manager Rating (0.03 weak correlation).\n• Work-Life Balance (0.017 very weak correlation).\n7) Retention Strategies\nWhich groups of employees are at the highest risk of leaving, and\nwhat strategies could reduce their likelihood of leaving?\nTo identify employees at high risk of leaving, analyze attrition trends based on key\nfactors like:\n• OverTime (workload)\n• Salary (compensation)\n• YearsAtCompany (tenure)\n• JobSatisfaction (happiness at work)\n• WorkLifeBalance (stress levels)\nGroups at Highest Risk of Leaving:\nLow Salary: Employees who left had an average salary of $81,956, much\n•\nlower than those who stayed ($125,856).\nShort Tenure: Those who left had ~2.5 years at the company, compared\n•\nto 7.4 years for those who stayed.\nJob Satisfaction: Employees at risk of leaving have an average job\nsatisfaction score of 3.45, indicating a moderate level of\ncontentment.\nStrategies to Reduce Attrition:\n1. Competitive Compensation: Increase salaries for newer employees to\nmatch industry standards.\n2. Career Growth Opportunities: Since shorter tenure employees leave\nmore often, provide fast-track promotions or clear career paths.\n3. Better Onboarding & Engagement: Support new hires in the first 2-3\nyears to ensure they feel valued.\n8) Impact of Overtime on Attrition\nDoes working overtime increase the likelihood of an employee leaving\nthe company?\nanalyze whether working overtime increases the likelihood of an employee leaving the\ncompany by checking the correlation between OverTime and Attrition.\nImpact of Overtime on Employee Attrition:\nEmployees who do NOT work overtime:\n•\n89.56% stay with the company.\no\n10.43% leave.\no\nEmployees who work overtime:\n•\n69.47% stay.\no\n30.53% leave.\no\nEmployees who work overtime are about 3 times more likely to leave the company\ncompared to those who don’t (30.53% vs. 10.43%). This suggests that excessive\novertime may contribute to employee burnout and attrition.\n9) Salary Prediction Based on Job Role\nWhat is the expected salary of an employee based on their\ndepartment, experience, and job role?\nthe salary prediction model achieved a mean absolute error of $65,765, indicating\nmoderate accuracy. Key insights:\n• HR Managers had the highest estimated salaries.\n• Recruiters and Sales Representatives had the lowest predicted salaries.\n• Salary increases with years at the company, peaking between 8-10 years\nTop 3 highest-paid roles:\n•\no HR Manager: $449,331.\no Analytics Manager: $346,484.\no General Manager: $317,531.\n• Bottom 3 lowest-paid roles:\no Recruiter: $37,648.\no Sales Representative: $40,656.\no Software Engineer: $51,967.\n• Average salary by years of experience:\no New employees (0 years): $91,418.\no Employees with 8–10 years of experience: $134,665 – $145,605.\nDataDynamos"
