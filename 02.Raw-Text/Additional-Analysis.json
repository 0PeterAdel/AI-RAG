This\nreport leverages employee data to uncover key insights into individual\nperformance, organizational talent potential, and HR strategy efficiency. By\nusing data analysis techniques in Python, we aim to support smarter\ndecision-making in training, promotion, and retention strategies.\nOverview of the Code Structure\nThis report analyzes employee data from a structured Excel file to evaluate performance,\npotential, and HR effectiveness. The insights are drawn using Python-based analytics and\naim to guide data-driven decisions in talent management.\nThree core frameworks were applied:\n1. GAP Analysis\n2. 9-Box Grid Analysis\n3. Balanced Scorecard Analysis\nThe dataset includes employee demographics, performance reviews, training history,\nsatisfaction levels, and career progression indicators.\nStage 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\nExcel File Structure\nThe Excel file used in this analysis contains five sheets with structured information:\n• Employee Sheet: Includes demographics, job details, and career progression fields\n(e.g., EmployeeID, JobRole, Department, Salary, HireDate, Attrition, etc.)\n• PerformanceRating Sheet: Historical reviews including ManagerRating,\nsatisfaction scores, training participation, and WorkLifeBalance.\n• EducationLevel / RatingLevel / SatisfiedLevel Sheets: Contain reference data to\ndecode categorical fields like education and satisfaction levels.\nWhat the Code Does:\n• The data was imported using Pandas.\n• Each sheet was loaded into a dedicated DataFrame.\n• Data types were adjusted (e.g., dates parsed correctly), and columns were renamed\nor merged as necessary for consistency across sheets.\n• Filtering and sorting were applied to ensure only the most recent performance\nreviews were considered where needed.\nResults\n• This structured loading process enabled clean, reliable analysis across the\nsubsequent stages: GAP Analysis, 9-Box Grid, and Balanced Scorecard.\n\nStage 2: GAP Analysis\nObjective\nIdentify performance discrepancies between employees and the benchmark for their job\nroles.\nProcess\n• Extracted the most recent ManagerRating per employee.\n• Calculated the average rating for each JobRole.\n• Computed a performance gap for each employee (Employee Rating − JobRole\nAverage).\nInterpretation:\n• Negative gaps indicate underperformance relative to the expected standard for that role.\n• A correlation was analyzed between TrainingOpportunitiesTaken and performance gaps,\nproviding insight into the impact of training.\nInsight:\nEmployees falling below their role average should be prioritized for development plans. This\nalso highlights the importance of personalized learning interventions.\n\n2: Training GAP Analysis\nObjective\nCalculate the gap between the training opportunities available and those attended, and\nidentify the top 10 employees who need more training.\nMethodology:\n1. Gap Calculation:\nCompute TrainingGap as the difference between TrainingOpportunitiesWithinYear and\nTrainingOpportunitiesTaken.\n2. Summary Statistics:\nUse descriptive statistics to summarize the training gap.\n3. Top 10 Employees Extraction:\nIdentify employees with the largest training gap and merge with their personal details.\n3: 9-Box Grid Analysis\nObjective:\nMap employees based on Current Performance and Future Potential to inform leadership development\nand succession planning.\nProcess\n• Performance: Defined by latest ManagerRating (1–2 = Low, 3 = Average, 4–5 = High).\n• Potential: Estimated by calculating the trend (slope) of ManagerRating over time.\n• Employees were placed into a 3x3 matrix based on these two factors.\nSteps in the Code:\n1. Calculate Slope (Trend): Use linear regression to estimate the trend (slope) of the ManagerRating over\ntime for each employee. This slope acts as a proxy for future potential.\n2. Categorize Performance: Employees are categorized into 'Low', 'Average', or 'High' based on their\ncurrent ManagerRating.\n3. Categorize Potential: For employees with valid slope values, quantile-based categorization is applied\nto assign them into potential categories.\n4. Create & Visualize Grid: Construct a crosstab of performance vs. potential and visualize it using a\nheatmap\nExpected Output::\n• A printed table (crosstab) showing the distribution of employees across the 9-box\ngrid.\n• A heatmap that visually represents this distribution, making it easy to identify\nclusters of talent.\n\n\n3: KPIs & Turnover Analysis\n-\nObjective:\nCalculate key HR metrics (KPIs) such as turnover rate, average satisfaction, and average tenure.\nAdditionally, analyze turnover by department, salary, and years of service.\nMethodology:\n1.Turnover Rate Calculation: Determine the percentage of employees who have left the\norganization.\n2. Satisfaction Analysis: Convert categorical satisfaction ratings into numerical values, then\ncompute the overall average satisfaction.\n3. Tenure Analysis: Calculate the average years employees have been with the company.\n4. Turnover Breakdown: Filter data for ex-employees and analyze turnover by department, median\nsalary, and median years at the company.\nExpected Output::\n• Printed KPIs including turnover rate, average satisfaction, and average tenure.\n• A breakdown of turnover statistics by department, median salary, and median\nexperience.\n\n4: Balanced Scorecard Analysis\n-\nObjective:\nAssess HR effectiveness across four strategic pillars:\nDimension Metric\nFinancial Attrition Rate (employee turnover as a cost indicator)\nEmployee Satisfaction Average of Environment, Job, and Relationship Satisfaction scores\nInternal Processes Training utilization, promotion frequency, and years in current roles\nLearning & Growth Training participation and recent promotion percentage\nMethodology:\nEach perspective is evaluated by:\n1. Financial Perspective:\nCalculate the attrition rate.\n2. Employee Satisfaction:\nCompute overall satisfaction by averaging various satisfaction measures.\n3. Internal Processes:\nCalculate training utilization (ratio of training taken to available training opportunities) and average\nyears since last promotion.\n4. Learning and Growth:\nDetermine the average training opportunities taken and the percentage of employees promoted in\nthe last year.\n5. Visualization:\nDisplay the key metrics using a bar chart.\nExpected Output::\n• Printed metrics including attrition rate, overall satisfaction, training utilization, years\nsince last promotion, average training taken, and percentage of recent promotions.\n• A bar chart visualizing these balanced scorecard metrics.\n\n\nConclusion\nThrough the use of Python and structured data analysis, the organization gains:\nA clear view of performance gaps by role\nA strategic talent map to guide promotions and succession\nA holistic HR performance dashboard to guide decision-making\nFinal Remarks Analysis Summary:\nGAP Analysis: Identifies performance gaps relative to job role averages. The analysis\nreveals which employees are underperforming relative to their peers.\nTraining Gap Analysis: Calculates the discrepancy between available and attended\ntraining opportunities. The top 10 employees with the largest gaps are highlighted,\nenabling targeted training interventions.\n9-Box Grid Analysis: Maps employees according to current performance and future\npotential. This tool helps in talent management by visualizing where employees stand and\ninforming succession planning.\nKPIs & Turnover Analysis: Provides key HR metrics, including employee turnover,\nsatisfaction, and tenure. It also breaks down turnover by department and other key\ndimensions.\nBalanced Scorecard: Integrates multiple HR dimensions (financial, satisfaction, internal\nprocesses, learning & growth) into a holistic view, enabling strategic decision-making.\n___________________________________________\nDataDynamos"
