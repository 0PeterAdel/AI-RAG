These figures indicate that the U.S. healthcare system relies\nheavily on employer-sponsored private insurance, with challenges in\nachieving comprehensive coverage for all residents.\n Adhering to labor laws concerning working hours and leave policies is essential to\navoid legal risks.\n Regularly reviewing employment contracts ensures compliance with any new\nlegal updates.\n Changes in labor regulations regarding employee benefits, pensions, and\ntermination policies may impact HR strategies.\n Intellectual property laws and data protection regulations require compliance in\nhandling employee records.\n Anti-discrimination and workplace harassment laws necessitate continuous HR\npolicy updates and employee training.\nRecommendations:\n1.
