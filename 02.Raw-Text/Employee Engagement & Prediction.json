The goal is to uncover insights that help\nimprove employee engagement, predict attrition, and optimize performance\nmanagement strategies through machine learning models. By leveraging both\ndescriptive and predictive analytics, we aim to provide practical\nrecommendations to support better talent management and recruitment\ndecision-making.\nOverview of the Code Structure\nThe code is structured into five main stages:\nThe code is organized into five key stages to perform a data-driven HR analysis:\n1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads employee data from \"HrData.xlsx,\"\nmerges it, and cleans it by handling missing values, removing outliers, and\nconverting categorical data to numeric format.\n2. Employee Engagement Analysis: Analyzes work environment satisfaction and\nits relationship with salary to assess employee satisfaction levels.\n3. Correlation Analysis: Examines relationships between features like age, salary,\nand tenure to identify patterns.\n4. Predictive Analytics: Builds and evaluates a model to predict employee\nattrition, identifying key factors influencing turnover.\n5. Visualization and Insights: Generates charts (boxplots, heatmaps, bar charts)\nand reports to visualize findings and provide actionable HR insights.\n1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\nWe assume the Excel file contains at least two sheets with the following structure:\n'Employee' Sheet: Columns include EmployeeID, Age, DistanceFromHome,\nDepartment, JobRole, Salary, HireDate, Attrition, YearsAtCompany,\nYearsSinceLastPromotion.\n'PerformanceRating' Sheet:\nColumns include EmployeeID, ReviewDate, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction,\nWorkLifeBalance, ManagerRating.\nWhat the Code Does:\n-Defines the file path (`file_path = \"HrData.xlsx\"`) and loads it using `pd.ExcelFile. `\n-Reads the \"Employee\" sheet into `df_employee` and the \"PerformanceRating\" sheet into\n`df_performance .`\n-Merges these two DataFrames on `EmployeeID` using a left join (`df_combined =\ndf_employee.merge(...)`), keeping all employee records and adding `EnvironmentSatisfaction` where\navailable.\nPrepares the data by :\n- Creating a numeric column `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric` from `EnvironmentSatisfaction.`\n- Filling missing values in this column with the mean.\n- Filtering out extreme salaries (`Salary < 400000`) into `df_filtered.`\n- Converting categorical columns (`OverTime` and `Attrition`) to numeric values (0 and 1) for\nmodeling .\nResults\n• A clean, merged dataset with numerical features ready for analysis.\n2: Employee Engagement Analysis\nObjective\nThis analysis evaluates employee satisfaction using `EnvironmentSatisfaction` and\nexplores its relationship with `Salary` (as a proxy for performance or reward).\nIt aims to identify if a satisfying work environment correlates with higher salaries and\nhighlights areas for improvement if satisfaction is low.\nSteps in the Code\n1)Data Preparation: Uses `df_filtered` (outliers removed) and `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric`\n(1-5 scale) .\n2)Visualization:\n- Creates a boxplot (`sns.boxplot`) showing salary distribution across satisfaction levels (1.0 to 5.0) .\n- Adds mean salary values on the plot for each level (e.g., 102473 for level 1.0, 103311 for level 2.0,\netc.).\n- Includes labels and a grid for clarity .\n3)Output: Prints the average `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric` score, which is\n3.87255592487703087 .\nInterpretation:\nAverage Environmental Satisfaction: The average satisfaction score is approximately 3.87 (on a 1-5\nscale). This indicates a generally positive work environment, as the score is closer to 4 than 3. However,\nit’s not close to 5, suggesting there’s room for improvement to reach high satisfaction levels.\nBoxplot Distribution:\n- The mean salaries for each satisfaction level are: 102473 (1.0), 103311 (2.0), 103738 (3.0), 95485\n(3.87255592487703087), 103178 (4.0), and 100647 .)5.0 (\n- There’s no clear trend showing that higher satisfaction leads to higher salaries. For example, the\nhighest mean salary (103738) is at satisfaction level 3.0, while the lowest (95485) is at the average\nsatisfaction level (3.87). This suggests that satisfaction doesn’t strongly correlate with salary in this\ndataset.\n- The boxplot shows some variability, with outliers (dots above the boxes) indicating a few employees\nwith significantly higher salaries across all satisfaction levels.\nImplications:\n- With an average satisfaction of 3.87, the work environment is decent but not exceptional. The\ncompany could aim for a score closer to 4.5 or 5 by improving workplace conditions (e.g., better facilities,\nmore flexible policies) or culture (e.g., recognition programs) .\n- The lack of a clear salary-satisfaction trend suggests that salary might not be the primary driver of\nsatisfaction, or other factors (e.g., job role, manager support) might be more influential.\n\n2: Correlation Analysis\nObjective\nThis analysis examines the relationships between key employee features (`Age`,\n`Salary`, `YearsAtCompany`, `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric`) to understand\nhow they correlate with each other. It helps identify patterns, such as whether older\nemployees tend to have higher salaries or longer tenures.\nSteps in the Code\n• Correlation Calculation: Computes the correlation matrix for the selected features.\n• Visualization:\n- Plots a heatmap (`sns.heatmap`) to visualize the correlations, with values annotated and\na color scale (`coolwarm`) .\n• Output: Prints the correlation matrix.\nInterpretation:\nCorrelation Matrix:\n- Age and YearsAtCompany: 0.642532 (strong positive correlation). Older employees tend to have\nlonger tenures, which makes sense as they’ve likely been with the company longer.\n- Age and Salary: 0.424894 (moderate positive correlation). Older employees generally have higher\nsalaries, possibly due to experience or seniority.\n- YearsAtCompany and Salary: 0.212381 (weak positive correlation). Longer tenure is slightly\nassociated with higher salaries, but the relationship is not strong\nWorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric:\n- With `Age`: 0.000745 (negligible correlation).\n- With `Salary`: -0.011273 (negligible negative correlation).\n- With `YearsAtCompany`: 0.009379 (negligible correlation) .\n- These values indicate that work environment satisfaction has almost no linear relationship with age,\nsalary, or tenure.\nHeatmap :\n- The heatmap visually confirms the above: strong correlations (e.g., 0.64) are in darker shades (red),\nwhile weak or no correlations (e.g., 0.000745) are in lighter shades (gray).\nImplications:\n- The strong correlation between `Age` and `YearsAtCompany` suggests that retention strategies\nmight focus on younger employees, as older ones are already staying longer.\n- The weak correlation between `Salary` and `YearsAtCompany` indicates that long tenure doesn’t\nguarantee higher pay, which might frustrate employees expecting raises over time .\n- The lack of correlation between `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric` and other features suggests\nthat satisfaction is independent of age, salary, or tenure, and might be influenced by other factors (e.g.,\nmanagement, work-life balance) .\n\n3: Predictive Analytics\nObjective:\nThis analysis uses machine learning to predict employee attrition (`Attrition`) and identify key\ninfluencing factors. It answers questions about who might leave and what drives turnover, providing\ninsights for retention and recruitment strategies.\nSteps in the Code:\nFeature Engineering :\n- Defines features: `Age`, `Salary`, `YearsAtCompany`, `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric`,\n`OverTime`, `DistanceFromHome.`\n- Ensures `Attrition` is numeric .)1/0(\n- Drops rows with missing values in these columns.\nModel Training :\n- Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets (`train_test_split`).\n- Trains a RandomForestClassifier with 100 trees and balanced class weights to handle imbalanced\ndata.\nEvaluation :\n- Predicts `Attrition` on the test set .\n- Calculates accuracy (0.9826086956521739) and generates a classification report .\n- Extracts and sorts feature importances (`YearsAtCompany`: 0.409201, `Salary`: 0.305103, `Age`:\n0.219830, `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric`: 0.0655866) .\nVisualization :\n- Plots a bar chart of feature importances.\nOutput :\n- Prints accuracy, classification report, feature importances, and target distribution (`Attrition`: 0:\n0.672271, 1: 0.327729).\nInterpretation:\nAttrition Prediction:\nAccuracy: 0.9826086956521739 (98.26%) is extremely high, indicating excellent predictive power.\nHowever, this might suggest overfitting, especially given the imbalanced dataset (see target distribution\nbelow).\nClassification Report:\n- No Attrition (0): Precision 1.00, Recall 0.98, F1-score 0.99, Support 943 .\n- Attrition (1): Precision 0.95, Recall 1.00, F1-score 0.97, Support 437.\n- The model is highly accurate for both classes, but the perfect recall for \"Attrition\" (1.00) and near-\nperfect precision for \"No Attrition\" (1.00) further suggest potential overfitting or an overly optimistic\nevaluation .\nMacro Avg: 0.97 (precision), 0.99 (recall), 0.98 (F1-score) .\nWeighted Avg: 0.98 across all metrics, reflecting the overall performance.\nFeature Importances:\nYearsAtCompany: 0.409201 (most important). Longer tenure significantly influences whether an\nemployee leaves, possibly due to stagnation or lack of growth opportunities.\nSalary: 0.305103 (second most important). Pay is a key factor in attrition, likely because low salaries\ndrive employees to seek better opportunities.\nAge: 0.219830. Age plays a moderate role, possibly with younger employees being more likely to leave for\nnew opportunities.\n- WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric: 0.0655866 (least important among shown features).\nSatisfaction has a minor impact on attrition in this model, which aligns with its weak correlations in\nAnalysis 2.\nTarget Distribution:\n`Attrition`: 0 (No): 67.23%, 1 (Yes): 32.77%. The dataset is imbalanced, with more employees staying\nthan leaving. This imbalance might inflate the accuracy, as the model could over-predict \"No Attrition\" to\nachieve high accuracy .\n-Feature Importance Bar Chart:\n- The bar chart visually confirms that `YearsAtCompany` has the highest importance (around 0.41),\nfollowed by `Salary` (0.31), `Age` (0.22), and `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric .)0.07( `\n-Recruitment Strategy Improvements:\n- From feature importances: Focus on candidates who value stability (`YearsAtCompany` is key) and\noffer competitive salaries (`Salary` matters). Younger employees (`Age`) might need more engagement\nto stay.\n- From target distribution: Since 32.77% of employees leave, retention efforts should target the at-risk\ngroup (e.g., those with long tenures but low salary growth).\n\nConclusion\nWhat the Script Delivers:\n-Employee Engagement Analysis:\nAssesses satisfaction via `WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric` (average 3.87) and its link to\n`Salary`. The lack of a clear trend between satisfaction and salary suggests other factors (e.g., job role,\nmanagement) might drive satisfaction. The company should aim to boost satisfaction to 4.5+ through\nbetter workplace conditions or culture .\n-Correlation Analysis:\nShows that `Age` and `YearsAtCompany` are strongly correlated (0.64), while\n`WorkEnvironmentSatisfactionNumeric` has negligible correlations with other features, indicating it’s\ninfluenced by factors not captured here .\n-Predictive Analytics:\nPredicts `Attrition` with high accuracy (98.26%), identifying `YearsAtCompany`, `Salary`, and `Age`\nas key drivers. However, the high accuracy may indicate overfitting due to the imbalanced dataset\n(67.23% stay, 32.77% leave). Retention strategies should focus on employees with long tenures,\ncompetitive pay, and younger staff.\n___________________________________________\nDataDynamos"
